# Kodo Improvement Proposals (KIPs)

Welcome to the Kodo Improvement Proposals (KIPs) repository. This repository serves as a central hub for all proposals aimed at improving and evolving the Kodo protocol. Our goal is to foster an open, transparent, and collaborative environment where the community can propose, discuss, and implement changes that will shape the future of Kodo.

## Historical Proposals

Below is a list of all KIPs, both past and present:

- [**KIP-000**](kip-000.md): Kodo Decentralization & Sustainability Plan - The initial proposal to transfer control of Kodo to the community, ensuring its long-term growth and sustainability.

## How to Contribute

- **Proposing a KIP**: To propose a KIP, start by creating a draft document in the `drafts` directory.
- **Discussing Proposals**: Engage with KIP authors and the community in the discussion phase. Your feedback is valuable and can help shape the proposal.
- **Voting on Proposals**: Once a proposal has been sufficiently discussed, it will be put to a vote by the DAO members. Proposals that receive the required level of support will move to the implementation phase.
- **Implementing a KIP**: Implementation can begin for proposals that have been approved by the community vote. This involves not only writing code and deploying contracts but also executing the necessary on-chain actions to bring the proposal to life.
