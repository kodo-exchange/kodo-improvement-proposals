# Kodo Improvement Proposal - 000

## Introduction

Dear Kodo Community,

We, the original team behind Kodo, have noticed that our control over Kodo has hindered its further development. In our quest to achieve our ambitious goal of becoming "the heartbeat of taiko's liquidity," we recognize the need for taiko's official support. After careful consideration, we, the initial team, propose the following changes to help Kodo grow better.

## Proposal

### Transfer of Control

The original team will give up all control of Kodo, transferring it to the community. This includes:

- **KODO and veKODO Holdings**
  - **KODO**: 8M KODO for bootstrapping liquidity in the KODO/WETH pool. Of the 20M allocated for voting rewards, 14M remain for future voting incentives, marketing, etc.
  - **veKODO**: Details at [veNFT Documentation](https://github.com/kodo-exchange/contracts/blob/main/veNFT.md)
  - *Action*: We'll deploy a secure, multi-signature wallet as a temporary measure until Gnosis Safe can be used with Taiko, ensuring a high level of security.

- **Smart Contract Permissions**
  - `voter.governor` for whitelisting tokens
  - `voter.emergencyCouncil` for killing/reviving a gauge
  - `minter.team` for team emission each epoch
  - `ve.team` for controlling veNFT display
  - *Action*: Transfer all permissions to the multisig wallet.

### Open-Sourcing and Domain Transfer

- **Client and Backend**
  - *Action*: We're making all our code public, so anyone can easily start their own version of Kodo client. This move will not only bolster the dapp's robustness but also facilitate the community in setting up backup sites for https://kodo.exchange. (Thanks to Frank for the kind reminder)

- **Domain**
  - The `kodo.exchange` domain will be transferred to Andy for safekeeping.

### Social Media Accounts

- **Platforms**: Twitter, Discord, and Medium
- *Action*: We're entrusting Andy with our social media accounts to ensure they remain in safe hands.

### Token Distribution

Just like initially planned, the original team will retain 3% of the initial tokens as a reward for past work and effort. These tokens will unlock according to a set schedule (six months of locking, followed by six months of linear unlocking). The allocation of these tokens will be to Anonymous B, Anonymous D, Snake, and Andy. Hiro decided to forego any token rewards until after Kodo's first successful year.

### Community Involvement

We warmly invite our community to nominate individuals (themselves or others) to control the multisig wallet, aiming for up to 5 community members plus Andy. Anyone can nominate. We'll check and get in touch.

### Ongoing Support

Our team is committed to tirelessly supporting Kodo's journey behind the scenes until it can operate smoothly without us.

## Core Values

We believe that success in crypto comes from being transparent, fair, and permissionless. These are the principles we've always stood by. The initial Kodo team loves Kodo like our own kid and wants it to succeed, just like you. With this initiative, we aim to empower Kodo's growth, drawing upon the unparalleled strength and wisdom of our incredible community.

## Note

We invite the community to discuss this proposal, which we plan to initiate based on your feedback. Announcements will be made on Twitter and Discord once we start.
