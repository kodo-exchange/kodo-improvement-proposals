# Kodo Improvement Proposal - 000

## Introduction

Hey Kodo Community,

We've noticed that the initial team's control over Kodo has hindered its further development. To achieve our ambitious goal of becoming "the heartbeat of taiko's liquidity," we need taiko's official support. After careful thought, we propose the following to help Kodo grow better.

## Proposal

### Transfer of Control

The original team will relinquish all control of Kodo, transferring it to the community. This includes:

- **KODO and veKODO Holdings**
  - **KODO**: 8M KODO for bootstrapping liquidity in the KODO/WETH pool. Of the 20M allocated for voting rewards, 14M remain for future voting incentives, marketing, etc.
  - **veKODO**: Details at [veNFT Documentation](https://github.com/kodo-exchange/contracts/blob/main/veNFT.md)
  - *Action*: Creation of a multisig wallet (using a well-tested smart contract temporarily until Gnosis Safe supports Taiko).

- **Smart Contract Permissions**
  - `voter.governor` for whitelisting tokens
  - `voter.emergencyCouncil` for killing/reviving a gauge
  - `minter.team` for team emission each epoch
  - `ve.team` for controlling veNFT display
  - *Action*: Transfer all permissions to the multisig wallet.

### Open-Sourcing and Domain Transfer

- **Client and Backend**
  - *Action*: Open-source all client and backend code, ensuring it's easy for anyone to start their own Kodo client. Multiple clients will enhance the dapp's robustness, including backup sites for kodo.exchange.

- **Domain**
  - The `kodo.exchange` domain will be transferred to Andy for safekeeping.

### Social Media Accounts

- **Platforms**: Twitter, Discord, and Medium
- *Action*: Transfer these accounts to Andy for safekeeping.

Just like initially planned, the original team will retain 3% of the initial tokens as a reward for past work and effort. These tokens will unlock according to a set schedule (six months of locking, followed by six months of linear unlocking).

### Community Involvement

We encourage the community to nominate individuals (themselves or others) to control the multisig wallet, aiming for up to 5 community members plus Andy.

### Ongoing Support

The initial team will continue supporting Kodo's development behind the scenes until it can operate smoothly without us.

## Core Values

We've always believed in transparency, fairness, and permissionlessness in crypto, standards we'll always uphold. The initial Kodo team loves Kodo like our own kid and wants it to succeed, just like you. This move is made out of love, not anything else.

## Note

This proposal is for community discussion and has not been initiated yet. Announcements will be made on Twitter and Discord once we start.
