# Kodo Improvement Proposal - 000

## Introduction

Hey Kodo Community,

We, the original team behind Kodo, have noticed that our control over Kodo has hindered its further development. In our quest to achieve our ambitious goal of becoming "the heartbeat of taiko's liquidity," we recognize the need for taiko's official support. After careful consideration, we, the initial team, propose the following changes to help Kodo grow better.

## Proposal

### Transfer of Control

The original team will give up all control of Kodo, transferring it to the community. This includes:

- **KODO and veKODO Holdings**
  - **KODO**: 8M KODO for bootstrapping liquidity in the KODO/WETH pool. Of the 20M allocated for voting rewards, 14M remain for future voting incentives, marketing, etc.
  - **veKODO**: Details at [veNFT Documentation](https://github.com/kodo-exchange/contracts/blob/main/veNFT.md)
  - *Action*: Creation of a multisig wallet (deploying a well-tested smart contract multisig wallet temporarily until Gnosis Safe supports Taiko).

- **Smart Contract Permissions**
  - `voter.governor` for whitelisting tokens
  - `voter.emergencyCouncil` for killing/reviving a gauge
  - `minter.team` for team emission each epoch
  - `ve.team` for controlling veNFT display
  - *Action*: Transfer all permissions to the multisig wallet.

### Open-Sourcing and Domain Transfer

- **Client and Backend**
  - *Action*: We will open-source all client and backend code, making it straightforward for anyone to initiate their own Kodo client. This move will not only bolster the dapp's robustness but also facilitate the community in setting up backup sites for kodo.exchange. (Thanks to Frank for the kind reminder)

- **Domain**
  - The `kodo.exchange` domain will be transferred to Andy for safekeeping.

### Social Media Accounts

- **Platforms**: Twitter, Discord, and Medium
- *Action*: Transfer these accounts to Andy for safekeeping.

Just like initially planned, the original team will retain 3% of the initial tokens as a reward for past work and effort. These tokens will unlock according to a set schedule (six months of locking, followed by six months of linear unlocking).

### Community Involvement

We encourage the community to nominate individuals (themselves or others) to control the multisig wallet, aiming for up to 5 community members plus Andy.

### Ongoing Support

The initial team will continue supporting Kodo's development behind the scenes until it can operate smoothly without us.

## Core Values

We believe that success in crypto comes from being transparent, fair, and permissionless. These are the principles we've always stood by. The initial Kodo team loves Kodo like our own kid and wants it to succeed, just like you. This initiative is designed to nurture Kodo's development, leveraging the collective strength and wisdom of the amazing community.

## Note

This proposal is for community discussion and has not been initiated yet. Announcements will be made on Twitter and Discord once we start.
