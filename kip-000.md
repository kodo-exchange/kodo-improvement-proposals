# Kodo Improvement Proposal - 000 - Decentralization & Sustainability Plan

## Introduction

Dear Kodo Community,

We, the initial team behind Kodo, have noticed that our control over Kodo has hindered its further development. In our pursuit to transform Kodo into a true public good within the Taiko ecosystem, we've come to appreciate the indispensable roles of transparency, fairness, and the collective intelligence of our community. Additionally, we understand the critical importance of trust and official support from Taiko. After careful consideration, we, the initial team, propose the following changes to help Kodo grow better.

## Proposal

### Transfer of Control

The original team will give up all control of Kodo, transferring it to the community (specificallly, a multisig wallet controlled by community-nominated individuals). This comprehensive transfer includes:

- **Smart Contract Permissions**
  - `voter.governor` for whitelisting tokens
  - `voter.emergencyCouncil` for killing/reviving a gauge
  - `minter.team` for team emission each epoch
  - `ve.team` for controlling veNFT display
  - `pairFactory.feeManager` for controlling stable and volatile fees
  - `pairFactory.pauser` for controlling whether all swaps are paused
  - *Action*: Transfer all permissions to the multisig wallet.

- **KODO and veKODO Holdings**
  - **Liquid KODO**: 8M KODO for bootstrapping liquidity, with 1 ETH provided by the initial team in the KODO/WETH pool. Of the 20M allocated for voting rewards, 14M remain for future voting incentives, marketing, etc.
  - **veKODO NFTs**: Details at [veNFT Documentation](https://github.com/kodo-exchange/contracts/blob/main/veNFT.md)
  - *Action*: We'll deploy a secure, multi-signature wallet as a temporary measure until Gnosis Safe can be used on Taiko, ensuring a high level of security.

Beyond the control mentioned above, due to Kodo's contracts being 100% immutable and non-proxied, the team no longer has any control over the smart contracts and core assets.

### Open-Sourcing and Domain Transfer

- **Client and Backend**
  - *Action*: We're making all our code public, so anyone can easily start their own version of Kodo client. This move will not only bolster the dapp's robustness but also facilitate the community in setting up backup sites for https://kodo.exchange. (Thanks to Frank for the kind reminder)

- **Domain**
  - *Action*: The `kodo.exchange` domain will be transferred to Andy for safekeeping.

### Social Media Accounts

- **Platforms**: Twitter, Discord, and Medium
- *Action*: We're entrusting Andy with our social media accounts to ensure they remain in safe hands.

### Nomination

We warmly invite our community to nominate individuals (themselves or others) to control the protocol, aiming for up to 5 community members plus Andy. Anyone can nominate. We'll check and get in touch.

We'll ask the nominee if they're willing to be the sole representative for Kodo. If they agree, they will have two spots in the multi-sig wallet, but they're willing to reveal their identity to Taiko.

The controllers of the multisig wallet have the authority to decide on the key operational actions within the protocol and deployment of funds, in addition to implementing the decisions made through community governance. We are looking forward to Taiko integrating DAO infrastructure, such as snapshot.org, to enable timely and effective community participation in the governance of the protocol. We will expedite the adoption of DAO tools by Kodo to facilitate effective community governance.

### Initial Team's Reward

Just like initially planned (check [here](https://docs.kodo.exchange/overview/tokenomics/initial-distribution#contributor-compensation-3)), the original team will retain 3% of the initial tokens as a reward for past work and effort. These tokens will unlock according to a set schedule (six months of locking, followed by six months of linear unlocking). The allocation of these tokens will be to Anonymous B, Anonymous D, Snake, and Andy (Hiro decided to forego any token rewards until after Kodo's first successful year.).

### Ongoing Support

Our team is committed to tirelessly supporting Kodo's journey behind the scenes until it can operate smoothly by the DAO without us.

## Core Values

We believe the success of Kodo stems from transparency and fairness to all our participants. The initial Kodo team loves Kodo like our own kid and wants it to succeed, just like you. With this initiative, we aim to empower Kodo's growth, drawing upon the unparalleled strength and wisdom of our incredible community.
